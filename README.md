Outside of data science, I enjoy spending time in nature, hiking, and staying active by going to the gym. I also have a creative side and love to express myself through painting.

I believe that my diverse range of interests allows me to approach data science from unique perspectives, which can lead to innovative solutions and valuable contributions. As a lifelong learner, I am constantly exploring new techniques and technologies to stay ahead of the curve and make a meaningful impact in the field of data science.
