Outside of data science, I enjoy spending time in nature, hiking, and staying active by going to the gym. I also have a creative side and love to express myself through painting.

As a lifelong learner, I am constantly exploring new techniques and technologies to stay ahead of the curve and make a meaningful impact in the field of data science.
